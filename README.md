# operating-platform
The client, The Gaming Room, required a web-based version of their Android game, "Draw It or Lose It," supporting multiple platforms, ensuring unique game and team names, and maintaining a single game instance in memory. The design includes a base Entity class with Game, Team, and Player classes inheriting from it, and the Game Service class using the Singleton pattern. The documentation clearly structured the system architecture and domain model, effectively using a UML class diagram to demonstrate class relationships. The evaluation of different operating platforms provided informed recommendations. The design document served as a clear blueprint, ensuring all requirements were systematically addressed, facilitating smoother development and integration processes. Enhancing the domain model section with more detailed explanations of methods and interactions within each class would improve clarity. User needs were interpreted by ensuring unique game and team names, maintaining a single game instance, and supporting multiple platforms, emphasizing the importance of user-friendly design. The approach included thorough requirement analysis, systematic planning, and detailed documentation with object-oriented design principles. Future strategies involve continuing these techniques and incorporating agile methodologies for iterative development and continuous feedback.
